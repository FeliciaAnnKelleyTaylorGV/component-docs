# WebAssembly Component Model Documentation

This repository contains user-facing documentation for the WebAssembly component model.  "User-facing" means it focuses on how to use the component model, not on the internal design and implementation details.

The documentation is published at <https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/>.

Documentation on WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) can be found at https://wasi.dev/. See the [`wasi.dev`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasi.dev) repository to contribute to that documentation.

Contributions are welcome - see [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info. Planned work is listed in the Issues section, but if there's content missing that you think would be helpful to gain understanding of the component model, please feel free to add a new issue, or send a PR directly!
